## Common Issues & Solutions

### Homebrew Issues
- If you see "Permission denied" during Homebrew installation:
  ```bash
  sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/share/zsh /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions
  ```
- If Homebrew commands aren't found, add to PATH:
  ```bash
  echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zshrc
  source ~/.zshrc
  ```

### Python Issues
- Use `python3` instead of `python`
- If pip isn't found, try:
  ```bash
  python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
  ```

### Permission Denied
If you see "Permission denied" errors:
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### Need Help?
If you run into any issues:
1. Make sure you're in the correct folder in Terminal
   - Use `pwd` to check your current location
   - Use `ls` to list files in the current folder
2. Make sure both Homebrew and Python are installed correctly
3. Try closing and reopening Terminal
4. Contact the project maintainer

To exit the program: Press `Control + C` in Terminal

### Why Homebrew?
While Python can be installed directly from python.org, using Homebrew provides several advantages:
- Easier to manage and update
- Better integration with macOS
- Simpler package management
- Avoids potential permission issues
- Industry standard for Mac development
